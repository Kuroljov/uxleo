Here we have source code of the project.

**About file structure** see in `about-files`  
**About gulp commands** avaliable see in `about-gulp-api`  
**Configurations for gulpfile** see in `config.coffee`

bower install

That will build a dev version of the project into /dest and start serve and watch :)
