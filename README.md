# uxleo zero

Here we have source code of the project. 
The goal is refactoring, so the main place to go is /src directory.

**About file structure** see in `about-files`  
**About gulp commands** avaliable see in `about-gulp-api`  

**To start working on project**

```
npm install
gulp build:dev:all
gulp
```

or just

```
npm install
gulp start
```

**NB** In this case server will be started before the building is completed
